# esnet

esnet is a library for recurrent neural networks using reservoir computing / echo state networks (ESN) with a high level easy to use API that is closely oriented towards sklearn. It aims to make the use of ESN intuitive, by providing algorithms for automatic gradient based hyperparameter tuning (of ridge regression penalty, spectral radius, leaking rate and feedback scaling), as well as transient time estimation. Furtheremore, it incorporates the ability to use spatio temporal ESNs for prediction and classification of geometrically extended input signals.


This package is an upgraded version of easyesn accessible from here: https://github.com/kalekiu/easyesn, which is based on the research results for the gradient based hyperparameter optimization and transient time estimation of Luca Thiede and the spatio temporal prediction and classification techniques of Roland Zimmermann.
